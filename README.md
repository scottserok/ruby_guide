# Ruby Guide

This is a small collection of small projects with a goal of helping beginners advance
their ability to read and support Ruby programs.

## Usage

Install all of the projects using

```
git clone git@github.com:scottserok/ruby_guide.git
```

Then move your terminal session to the `ruby_guide/` directory or open it up in your IDE.
Each subdirectory contains a small self-contained project complete with a *Gemfile* and
README for instructions.
