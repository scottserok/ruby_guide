# Ruby Guide

This is a small collection of small projects with a goal of helping beginners advance
their ability to read and support Ruby programs.

## Usage

Install all of the projects using `git clone`. If you're not familiar with git
check out the [git overview page](/GIT.md).

```
git clone https://github.com/scottserok/ruby_guide.git
```

Then move your terminal session to the `ruby_guide/` directory or open it up in your IDE.
Each subdirectory contains a small self-contained project complete with a *Gemfile* and
README for instructions.

### Recommended Sequence

1. `hello_world`
1. `palindrome`
1. `status_ok`
1. `widget_factory`
