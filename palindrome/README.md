# Palindrome

"a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., _madam_ or
_nurses run_."

## Instructions

Install the project dependencies with the `bundle install` command.

Run the tests with `rake test`. They will fail, they're supposed to fail.  Your job is to
fix the code in the `lib` directory so that the tests pass. Don't modify the test file in
order to make the tests pass.

Once you're able to get the tests to pass by modifying the code in the `lib` directory,
try adding another test in the `tests/palindrome_test.rb`.
